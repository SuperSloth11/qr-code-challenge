## Overview

Hello, thank you for looking at my project. This is my first in hopefully a long series of coding challenges. This serves as a brief introduction to my motivations and learning goals.

I am in my late thirties and want to change careers. I remember taking an introductory web design class in college. I really enjoyed coding HTML and CSS. It was very intuitive to me, and I liked the logic behind it. I also liked creating things from essentially nothing. However, I took that course in my final quarter of school. I was already graduating in a completely different career, and the internet was far too new a concept to pivot to it at that point. Looking back, I wish I had discovered web design far sooner.

Which brings me to today. When I decided I wanted to change careers, I remembered that web design course and how much I liked it, how easy it was, and that I excelled in it. There's no time like the present, so I am revisiting the idea of being a front end web developer. Technology has changed quite a bit in 20 years, but HTML and CSS are essentially the same. I am excited to be on this journey and so curious about all the things I have to learn ahead of me.

Thank you again for reviewing my project. I look forward to any feedback!

### What I learned

I learned that it's best to put in all of your HTML structure before styling, and when styling, to start from "in" to "out". When I tried going "out" to "in", the elements weren't behaving like I wanted them to. I'm sure there are many easier ways to do it, but so far that's the best one I've discovered.
